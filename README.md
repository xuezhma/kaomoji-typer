## Default Key Binding:
`1` - `9` . : Shortcut to have a kaomoji replace current world

`-`  : Scroll to previous tab when there are more than 9 suggestions

`=`  : Scroll to previous tab when there are more than 9 suggestions

`Shift` + `Space`  : Toggle the application

 e.g. "be" => matches "bears" =>  suggests: 

1. ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ
2. ᶘಠᴥಠᶅ
3. ʕノ•ᴥ•ʔノ ︵ ┻━┻
4. ┳┳ヾ(T(エ)Tヽ)

Type `1` and "be" will be replaced with "ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ" in text area.
